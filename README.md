# Yo, Welcome to My Digital Pad! ðŸ‘‹

Hey there! So, this is basically my little slice of the internet, a super chill portfolio website where I'm gonna be showing off my design adventures.

### What's the Vibe?

I'm really into that clean, minimalist, black and white look, you know? Less is more, right? So, that's what I was going for here â€“ super simple, super clear, and hopefully, super cool. It's built with good ol' HTML, CSS, and a dash of JavaScript to make things move.

### Check Out These Bits I'm Kinda Proud Of:

* **My Avatar Loader:** Seriously, click on my profile pic! I spent a bit of time making that console-style loading animation. It's a fun little secret handshake.
* **Light/Dark Mode:** Because who doesn't love options? Hit that moon/sun icon up top to switch between my signature dark mode and a crisp light mode.
* **That Scrollbar Tho:** Yeah, even the scrollbar got a custom makeover. It's tiny but mighty, and keeps the whole minimalist vibe going.
* **Helldivers 2 Easter Egg!** If you scroll all the way down, you'll spot my little nod to Helldivers 2 with that "WEBSITE UNDER CONSTRUCTION" banner. Managed democracy, baby!
* **Fits Everywhere:** Whether you're on a big screen or just chilling on your phone, this site should look pretty decent.

### So, What's Next?

Right now, it's pretty much a landing page because, well, it's still **UNDER CONSTRUCTION**! But stick around, I'm gonna be filling it up with all my design projects, experiments in Blender, Unreal Engine, Unity â€“ basically, all the cool stuff I'm cooking up.
